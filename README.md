# cleanup-cloud-resources
In order to clean up the resources after testing, We can use cloud-nuke -> https://github.com/gruntwork-io/cloud-nuke.
I am using cloud nuke to clean up the resources I created using terrafom (forgot to run terraform destroy) or manually for testing and development work.
This will make sure that I wont have to incurr any unwanted expenses in Cloud. 

Install cloud-nuke is very straight forward

`brew install cloud-nuke`
